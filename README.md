# PoCN_Project
This repository contains the code, data, and report for two projects completed as part of the course Physics of Complex Networks done by the student Miguel Avil√©s Moreno. The projects focus on computational modeling and network analysis in the context of sociophysics, using R programming in Jupyter Notebooks and standalone R scripts.
